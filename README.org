#+DESCRIPTION: my emacs config diaries!
#+AUTHOR: rho
#+OPTIONS: num:t toc:1
#+STARTUP: overview


*BEWARE:* AUTHOR does'nt know much *elisp* and suffer from
*parenthesiophobia*, but couldn't stop tinker around.


* INTRO

  I've been using /emacs/ since *2012*, It has been the love and hate
  story since day one, In summary *emacs rocks but 🪨 rocks are not so
  pretty*, and here you are looking at not so *pretty* side.

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    FYI "emacs vanilla is a lie"
  #+END_EXAMPLE

** about

   Customization began with *single-file* =~/.emacs= with few settings
   and some random *snippets*. Didn't took long to become monster. It
   loved to *cherry-picked* 🍒 packages literally form anywhere, I was
   like why don't you *apt-get*.

   It was becoming difficult maintaining 📦 packages manually,
   tracking workable dependencies and freezing 🧊 versions. And came
   =package.el=, which I noticed in [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/efaq/New-in-Emacs-24.html][What's new in emacs24]] using
   *emacs25*. also [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/el-get][el-get]] existed, and now =package.el= was official
   too. I can't seem to [[https://github.com/dimitri/el-get/issues/1468][choose]] one, and great can use both.

   Yet, I could barely remember *Why I removed that package, what
   happen?*, *git-whatchanged* would have told me more if it was a
   *code*. To =org= organize was most sane thing till now
   [[https://github.com/rhoit/dot-emacs/blob/master/init.el][~/emacs.d/init.el]] was orgified (org-babel-tangle).

** getting-it

   🧨 *DISCLAIMER:* 🐒 MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE BACKUP ⚠️ AUTHOR will
   _not_ be _responsible_ for the 🔥 _harm_ 🔥 cause by using this
   configuration.

   Oh! you wanna use my config! its super duper +easy+ ! may be in
   future I'm still +trying+ avoiding make the installer (literally
   don't know how) and just trying to get by my work.

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     $ git clone https://github.com/rhoit/dot-emacs /path/to/dot-emacs
   #+END_EXAMPLE

** why-this-config?

   There is absolutely no reason for you to use this config, it would
   be like first time 🏊 swimmer, who mostly likely drown with
   unnecessary amount of effort. Although I'm great at underwater so
   to say some what athletic *underachievers*.

   Time 🕥 and time 🕝 again I learned *elisp* just to forget with
   endless pondering and compromises, without ✍️ jotting things down,
   it would have been impossible to configure. May be this started for
   maintenance, now its more of rants taking over the configuration! 😎

   If you ask, would I have started with other's config? I would
   definitely say *YES*. But you should *understand* all-in-one
   package 📦 or distribution is like bringing gun 🔫 to the fist 👊
   fight. You might end up using less than 5 % of the *bloat*. And if
   you want to change or fix something it big 😫 pain to pealing
   layers after layers to find the actual root cause. Yet you might
   want to try these first

** structure

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     Entropy is important but not here
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   This is the way, I keep my things have been same for many year now!

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

   #+END_EXAMPLE

** troubleshooting

   While troubleshooting I go though these procedure (may not be in
   same ordering)

   - hate myself when it happens
   - *REMOVE* the damn plugin and *GET BACK TO WORK*
   - *throw* ERROR MSG at google and try *catching* relevant pages
   - may be waste few hrs with random *trials*
   - set debug variable

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
       (setq debug-on-error 1)
       (setq debug-on-quit t)  ;; C-g
     #+END_SRC

* CORE
** server

   Stop ⛔ opening *emacs* for each file. Set default open application
   to *emacsclient*, or set it manually:

   =emacsclient --no-wait--alternate-editor=emacs [FILE]=

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (require 'server)
     (unless (server-running-p)
       (server-start))
   #+END_SRC

** backup

   I don't like mess every where, there is better things for that
   called git!

   #+HEADER: :results silent
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (setq backup-directory-alist (quote ((".*" . "~/.cache/emacs_backup/"))))
     (setq make-backup-files nil)
     (setq auto-save-default nil)
     (setq create-lockfiles nil)
   #+END_SRC

** big files

   Warn when opening files bigger than 1 MiB. yup *emacs* kitchen sink
   can open 🌇 image, PDF but seriously 😵 ?

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (setq large-file-warning-threshold (* 1 1024 1024))
   #+END_SRC

   You might wonder why that random number!

   | kilobyte (kB)  | 1000 bytes     |
   | [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibibyte][kibibyte]] (KiB) | 1024 bytes, kB |

   Since digital systems worked in binary, yet *defacto* is in base of
   2, Still interface don't show *kibi*, *mebi*, *gibi*. I don't think
   I'm only one who feel 😠 cheated getting HDD of *1 TB* and you
   getting *0.931* TB.

** pacman

   There are many 📦 package managers for *emacs*, ranging from simple
   scripts to download files from [[https://www.emacswiki.org][EmacsWiki]] to full-featured package
   management solutions like [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight.el]], these are few I have used

   Its *2020*, it has been harder to maintain packages with two
   managers. Finally decided to drop *el-get* in favor of build in
   [[package.el]].

*** package.el

    Add package other sources

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (require 'package) ;; after 24 its pre-loaded
      (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/elpa/")
      (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") t)
      (add-to-list 'package-archives '("org" . "https://orgmode.org/elpa/") t)
      (package-initialize)
    #+END_SRC

    Use =M-x package-refresh-contents= to reload the list of packages
    after adding these for the first time.

    - <2020-02-02 Sun>

      having troubles with org-version babel [[https://github.com/io12/org-fragtog/issues/1][support]]. using org
      package-archives for latest stuff.

*** el-get
    :PROPERTIES:
    :header-args: :tangle no
    :END:

    [[https://github.com/dimitri/el-get][el-get]] is the package manager, which is similar to *apt-get*. Not
    using since starting of *2020*.

    #+BEGIN_HTML
      <details><summary>More</summary>
    #+END_HTML

    Its bit tricky to make both *ELPA* and *el-get* work together, but
    after years of procrastination, some how this works, you should
    load *el-get* first, but *emacs24+* loads =package.el= by default,
    thats why put this magic line before loading *el-get* =(setq
    package-enable-at-startup nil)=

    #+HEADER: :results silent
    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/el-get")
      (require 'el-get)
      (setq el-get-git-shallow-clone 't)
      (el-get 'sync)
    #+END_SRC

    To replicate a package set for another emacs installation is
    explain in el-get [[https://github.com/dimitri/el-get#replicating-a-package-set-on-another-emacs-installation][README]].

    #+BEGIN_HTML
      </details>
    #+END_HTML

* UI

  As of today, most people who use *vi* or *emacs* are [[https://github.com/fuqcool/atom-emacs-mode#deprecated][incapable]] of
  using the other editor without using curse words 😡. Not
  surprisingly normal people without prior knowledge any text editor
  are pretty comfortable even 🪟 *notepad* make much more sense than
  *emacs* or *vi*. Yes you can pretty much do any *text foo* with
  these editor, even without touching 🐁 pointing device, but really
  does it really need to be like this.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (load "~/.emacs.d/config/ui.cfg.el")
  #+END_SRC

** theme

*** theme-switch

    Worst part of switching theme by loading is active theme is one
    disabled before loading the new one! this 🪄 trick was stolen from
    [[https://github.com/thapakazi][@thapakazi]].

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (defun theme-switch (theme)
        "Disables any currently active themes and loads THEME."
        ;; This interactive call is taken from `load-theme'
        (interactive
         (list (intern (completing-read "Load custom theme: "
                                        (mapc 'symbol-name
                                              (custom-available-themes))))))
        (let ((enabled-themes custom-enabled-themes))
          (mapc #'disable-theme custom-enabled-themes)
          (load-theme theme t)))
    #+END_SRC

** scroll

   Unfortunately *emacs* 💈 [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SmoothScrolling][scrolling]] 💈 is not smooth, and riddled
   with bugs, although =pixel-scroll-mode=, available since *v26*, there
   are numerous scrolling options but it doesn't feel natural.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
     (require 'smooth-scroll)
     (smooth-scroll-mode t)

     ;; (setq scroll-conservatively 100000)
     (setq scroll-conservatively 0) ;; cursor on the middle of the screen
     ;; (setq scroll-preserve-screen-position 1)

     (setq scroll-margin 0)
     (setq scroll-up-aggressively 0.01)
     (setq scroll-down-aggressively 0.01)
     (setq auto-window-vscroll nil)

     (setq mouse-wheel-progressive-speed 10)
     (setq mouse-wheel-follow-mouse 't)
   #+END_SRC

** line-number

   As in this [[http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_line_number_mode.html][article]] of *ergoemacs*, 2 line numbers mode is been
   📦 packaged with *emacs*.

   | year | emacs | package                          |
   |------+-------+----------------------------------|
   | 2009 |    23 | linum-mode                       |
   | 2018 |    26 | global-display-line-numbers-mode |

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     ;; (global-display-line-numbers-mode)
   #+END_SRC

   I used multiple [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/LineNumbers][line number]] plugins over years now, [[https://github.com/thefrontside/frontmacs/blob/master/frontmacs-windowing.el][frontmacs]]
   config stood out for me the, but *linum* give lots of flicker, now
   using with *nlinum* which is quite good.

   #+HEADER: :results silent
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (require 'nlinum)

     (setq nlinum-delay t)
     (setq nlinum-highlight-current-line t)
     (setq nlinum-format " %4d ")

     (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'nlinum-mode)
     (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'nlinum-mode)
   #+END_SRC

** initial-screen

   #+HEADER: :results silent
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (setq inhibit-startup-message t)
     (setq inhibit-splash-screen t)
   #+END_SRC

** tabbar

   [[https://github.com/rhoit/dot-emacs/blob/master/config/tabbar.cfg.el][tabbar]] is something familiar to modern 🍭 GUI system, there is
   still the gap, like key-bindings, close buttons and icons which is
   which [[https://github.com/mattfidler/tabbar-ruler.el][tabbar-ruler]] tries to address.

   #+ATTR_HTML: title="tabbar-screenshot"
   [[https://github.com/mattfidler/tabbar-ruler.el][file:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhoit/tabbar-ruler.el/dump/screenshots/01.png]]

   #+HEADER: :results silent

     (require 'tabbar)
     (tabbar-mode t)

     (setq FILE-tabbar "~/.emacs.d/00-tests/tabbar-ruler/tabbar-ruler.el")
     (if (file-exists-p FILE-tabbar)
       (load-file FILE-tabbar)
       (require 'tabbar-ruler))

     (setq tabbar-ruler-style 'firefox)

     (load "~/.emacs.d/cfg.tabbar.el")
     (define-key global-map (kbd "<header-line> <mouse-3>") 'mouse-buffer-menu)
   #+END_SRC

   #+BEGIN_HTML

     (define-key global-map [(control next)] 'tabbar-forward)
     (define-key global-map [(control prior)] 'tabbar-backward)
   #+END_SRC

   grouping the tab by buffer name

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (setq tabbar-buffer-groups-function (lambda ()
       (list (cond
         ((string-match ".*magit.*" (buffer-name)) "magit Buffers")
         ((string-match "TAGS" (buffer-name)) "ctags")
         ((string-match "*pdb.*" (buffer-name)) "pdb Buffers")
         ((string-match "*helm.*" (buffer-name)) "helm Buffers")
         ((string-equal "*" (substring (buffer-name) 0 1)) "emacs Buffers")
         ((eq major-mode 'dired-mode) "Dired")
         (t "User Buffers")
     ))))
   #+END_SRC

   Binding for the tab groups, some how I use lots of buffers.

   #+HEADER: :results silent
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (global-set-key [(control shift prior)] 'tabbar-backward-group)
     (global-set-key [(control shift next)] 'tabbar-forward-group)
   #+END_SRC

** [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SpeedBar][speedbar]]

   I prefer speedbar outside the frame, for without separate frame see
   [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SrSpeedbar][SrSpeedbar]].

* UX

  Fundamentally *emacs* is more over a scratchpad for *elisp*, which
  has been mistaken for the *editor*. Just 30+ years focused on
  features accumulation with barely any attention to GUI, I'm baffled
  when people come up with ⌨️ keybinding for each mode and mode to
  manage them again with keybindings. I'm one of those who can't
  remember all those fancy keyboard *kungfu*. And why do they
  generalize everyone uses same key layout and so call most efficient
  *vi* binding, just 🔒 locks me inside without the exit🚪!

** oem

   I don't understand why laptops 💻 OEM constantly change the key
   layouts. But why perfectly good layout are replace by terrible
   designs, Not to mention combining @@html:<kbd>@@ delete
   @@html:</kbd>@@ and @@html:<kbd>@@ backspace @@html:</kbd>@@.

   Some time you need to [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/DEL-Does-Not-Delete.html][explicitly]] say what to do.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     ;;; you might not need this
     (normal-erase-is-backspace-mode 1)
   #+END_SRC

** sane-binding
*** buffer-close

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      ;;; since, C-x k <return> too much acrobat
      (global-set-key [(control d)] 'kill-buffer)  ; same as terminal
    #+END_SRC

** yes-or-no

   yup thing are annoying 😤 here! avoid typing complete 'yes' and
   'no'.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (fset 'yes-or-no-p 'y-or-n-p)
   #+END_SRC

** update-buffer

   A fancy :bowtie: way of saying any change in file (yup not using
   same editor, duh!) will magically 🎩 appear in editor.

   #+HEADER: :results silent
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (global-auto-revert-mode)
     ;;(setq auto-revert-verbose nil)
   #+END_SRC

** undo

   @@html:<kbd>@@Ctrl@@html:</kbd>@@-@@html:<kbd>@@z@@html:</kbd>@@ is
   synonyms to undo not here because its [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_character][suspend]] to background in 🐚
   shell, Since *emacs* traces it roots from the *terminal*.

   #+HEADER: :results silent
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     ;;; this is confusion
     (global-unset-key (kbd "C-z")) ; unbind (suspend-frame)
   #+END_SRC

*** undo-tree

    [[http://www.dr-qubit.org/undo-tree.html][undo-tree]] preserve your undo chain and maintain undo branching.

    #+HEADER: :results silent
    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (require 'undo-tree)
      (dim-minor-name 'undo-tree-mode "")

      (global-undo-tree-mode 1)
      (setq undo-tree-visualizer-timestamps t)

      ;; normal undo and redo
      (global-set-key (kbd "C-z") 'undo-only)
      (global-set-key (kbd "C-S-z") 'undo-tree-redo)
    #+END_SRC

    - <2020-02-12 Wed> retrying undo-tree again!

      there are moments when =undo-tree= [[http://www.dr-qubit.org/Lost_undo-tree_history.html][breaks down]] but, it has been a
      while it hasn't or simply I haven't been working enough!
      *COVID-19* :mask:

    - <2018-11-13 Tue> stopped using undo-tree

      full days work vanished :disappointed_relieved: thinking I would
      undo would handle it.

** search
*** anzu

    [[https://github.com/syohex/emacs-anzu][anzu]] highlight all search matches, most of the text editor does
    even [[https://github.com/osyo-manga/vim-anzu][vi]] this why not emacs. Here is the [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/syohex/emacs-anzu/master/image/anzu.gif][gify]] from original
    repository.

    #+HEADER: :results silent
    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (require 'anzu)

      (global-anzu-mode +1)
      (global-unset-key (kbd "M-%"))
      (global-unset-key (kbd "C-M-%"))

      (global-set-key (kbd "C-M-%") 'anzu-query-replace-regexp)
    #+END_SRC

** cursor
*** beacon-mode

    [[https://github.com/Malabarba/beacon][beacon]] gives extra feedback of cursor's position on big movement.
    It can be understood better with this [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Malabarba/beacon/master/example-beacon.gif][gify]] from original
    repository.

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (require 'beacon)

      (setq beacon-blink-delay '0.2)
      (setq beacon-blink-when-focused 't)
      (setq beacon-dont-blink-commands 'nil)
      (setq beacon-push-mark '1)

      (dim-minor-name 'beacon-mode "")
      (beacon-mode t)
    #+END_SRC

*** multiple-cursor

    If [[https://www.sublimetext.com/][sublime]] can have [[https://github.com/magnars/multiple-cursors.el][multiple]] cursor, *emacs* can too.

    Here is 📹 [[https://youtu.be/jNa3axo40qM][video]] from [[http://emacsrocks.com/][Emacs Rocks!]] about it in [[http://emacsrocks.com/e13.html][ep13]].

    #+HEADER: :results silent
    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (require 'multiple-cursors)
      (global-set-key (kbd "C-S-<mouse-1>") 'mc/add-cursor-on-click)

      (global-set-key (kbd "C-S-<mouse-4>") 'mc/mark-previous-like-this)
      (global-set-key (kbd "C-S-<mouse-5>") 'mc/mark-next-like-this)
      (global-set-key (kbd "C-S-<mouse-2>") 'mc/mark-all-like-this)
    #+END_SRC

** selection

   Some of the default behavior of *emacs* 💩 weird, text-selection is
   on of them, some time its the 🌈 *WOW* 🦄 moment 🥳 and other time
   its *WTF*.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     ;;; doing expected things
     (delete-selection-mode 1)
   #+END_SRC

*** why-changing-fonts

    Hotkey for *font dialog* is kinda absurd, that to for changing
    font-face, although for resize has *Ctrl* *mouse-scroll* might be
    sensible option.

    In the effort of not being weird *Shift* *mouse-primary-click* is
    used in region/text selection =mouse-save-then-kill=.

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (global-unset-key [(shift down-mouse-1)])  ; unbind (mouse-apperance-menu EVENT)
      (global-set-key [(shift down-mouse-1)] 'mouse-save-then-kill)
    #+END_SRC

    *so called wow moments*

    as you think selecting selection, emacs binds the selection
    keyboard free, when followed by *mouse-secondary-click* if its not
    in conflict.

*** [[https://github.com/magnars/expand-region.el][expand region]]

    Expand region increases the selected region by semantic units.

    Here is [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RvHz3vJ3kA][video]] from [[http://emacsrocks.com/][Emacs Rocks!]] about it in [[http://emacsrocks.com/e09.html][ep09]].

** mini-buffer
*** helm

    Although [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][helm]] features are from the another league, I have not
    gone beyond the minibuffer. It took me while to get hang of it,
    one of reasons might be constant flickering creation of helm
    temporary popup windows 🪟 which I don't like.

** text zoom

   I still don't understand 😒 why *emacs* way of changing font [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SetFonts#ChangingFontSize][size]]
   is weird. Mapping behavior similar to web-browser might be helpful
   to have cohesive experience.

   | zoom | keyboard         | keyboard + mouse         |
   |------+------------------+--------------------------|
   | in   | Ctrl + Shift + = | Ctrl + mouse-scroll-up   |
   | out  | Ctrl + -         | Ctrl + mouse-scroll-down |
   | 1x   |                  | Ctrl + 0                 |

*** drag

    After using *org-mode* nothing is same, moving the section is one
    of the feature you want to have every where. Although many do have
    feature to drag a lines or the region. [[https://github.com/rejeep/drag-stuff.el][drag-stuff]] is great but its
    default binding is conflicts with *org-mode*.

** debugger

   Although I barely use *debugger*, lets say I'm more of =print()=
   person, may be because I work much with =python= than =C=.
   Nevertheless, a good IDE should have 🐛 debugger, but *emacs* is
   +TextEditor+ OS, and ships with *Grand Unified Debugger* (GUD), its
   fairly usable with terrible defaults and not to mention with more
   key bindings.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     ;; unlike gdb, pdb is a inbuilt python module
     (setq gud-pdb-command-name "python -m pdb")
   #+END_SRC

   GUD is great but [[https://github.com/realgud/realgud/][realgud]] much better, although you will miss
   *gdb-multiple-windows* but it does'nt work with *pdb* to begin
   with. If you ask why realgud here is some interesting [[https://github.com/realgud/realgud/blob/09431a4561921bece36a6083b6e27ac4dc82432d/realgud.el#L36-L47][rant]] from its

** white-spaces

   If you have working with non-emacs people sooner or later you might
   face this problem, those pesky trailing spaces/tabs.

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     Phenomenal Cosmic Powers! Itty Bitty trailing spaces!
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   Although end result might be same but it all shows in diff, ideally
   there should be no empty lines at the beginning of a file, no empty
   lines at the end of a file, no trailing whitespace, no mixture of
   tabs and spaces, etc.

   older =delete-trailing-whitespace= command, that simply deletes
   trailing white-space.

   =whitespace-cleanup= aware of the whitespace-style variable, used
   by whitespace-mode.

   different types of hooks

   - write-file-hooks
   - before-save-hooks

   #+END_SRC

   [[https://github.com/nflath/hungry-delete][hungry-delete]] mode is interesting but still its quirky, mapping it
   to default *delete/backspace* will result typing your needed
   white-spaces back again! So as the mode its *NO*, *NO*. Manually
   toggling the mode just to delete few continous white spaces. Naah!

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (require 'hungry-delete)
     (global-set-key (kbd "S-<backspace>") 'hungry-delete-backward)

** [[http://emacsredux.com/blog/2013/05/22/smarter-navigation-to-the-beginning-of-a-line/][smarter move to beginning of line]]

   Normally *C-a* will move your cursor to 0th column of the line,
   this snippet takes consideration of the indentation, and for
   default behavior "repeat the action" which will toggle between the
   first non-whitespace character and the =bol=.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (global-set-key [remap move-beginning-of-line]

   #+END_SRC

** [[http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/modernization_upcase-word.html][toggle lettercase]]

   By default, you can use M-c to change the case of a character at
   the cursor's position. This also jumps you to the end of the
   word. However it is far more useful to define a new function by
   adding the following code to your emacs config file. Once you have
   done this, M-c will cycle through "all lower case", "Initial
   Capitals", and "ALL CAPS" for the word at the cursor position, or
   the selected text if a region is highlighted.

     (global-set-key "\M-c" 'toggle-letter-case)
