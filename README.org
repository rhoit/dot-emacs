*BEWARE:* AUTHOR does'nt know much *elisp* and suffer from
*parenthesiophobia*, but couldn't stop tinker around.

* INTRO

  I've been using /emacs/ since *2012*, It has been the love and hate
  story since day one, In summary *emacs rocks but 🪨 rocks are not so
  pretty*, and here you are looking at not so *pretty* side.

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    FYI "emacs vanilla is a lie"
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  *Emacs* is relics of the past, have a criminal [[http://www.manuelmagic.me/manuelsweb/resources/Geek/Text-editors/text_editors.pdf][learning curve]] 🌀 are
  cursed with the worst *UI* known to mankind with most unpleasing to
  looks I mean it's a real dumpster 💩. It is not necessary to know
  how to use *emacs* in order to be unhappy 😩, but it helps. I have
  been constant search for the alternative over the years, non has
  come closer than *vscode* capture the same imagination constant
  improvement like in [[https://slate.com/technology/2014/05/oldest-software-rivalry-emacs-and-vi-two-text-editors-used-by-programmers.html][editor wars]].

  My nearly a decade long journey with *emacs* is nothing compared to
  age of the application which predates me and also the one of the
  longest lived application programs of all time. Yet to become
  obsolete, which is still ongoing development since 1976. Flexibility
  of altering its interface and behavior without going though original
  source has let to creation of surplus features by generation of
  users 🤓 (programmers). There has been some of 💫 indispensable
  tools which are yet to be match modern word processors.

  It might be difficult for me to abandon the *emacs* although its
  prized features would be replicated soon some day. Over the years I
  constantly hear about [[https://lwn.net/Articles/819452/][Making Emacs popular again]] but its unlikely to
  happen again since entry barrier is too high. The *vscode* with
  built with the most popular language possess significant development
  advantage, unlike *emacs* built with *lisp*. Yet this repository
  itself stands as a testament about developers relation with text
  editor, which mean switching to new editor will need significant
  investment of time, not to mention [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IKEA_effect][IKEA effect]].

** introspect

   We need more contributors to make *emacs* better. We need better
   *emacs* to attract more users who can later contribute back. Its
   never ending dilemma. Still there number of unfortunate facts about
   how *emacs* works. Most users will eventually need to dive into
   *elisp* in order get to their particular tastes. I have been using
   *emacs* for years sheer size of the project hard to comprehend
   itself. But recent years *emacs* has seen numerous improvement like
   [[lsp][lsp]], native-compilation, yet *emacs* still needs more.

** about

   Customization began with *single-file* =~/.emacs= with few settings
   and some random *snippets*. Didn't took long to become monster. It
   loved to *cherry-picked* 🍒 packages literally form anywhere, I was
   like why don't you *apt-get*.

   It was becoming difficult maintaining 📦 packages manually,
   tracking workable dependencies and freezing 🧊 versions. And came
   =package.el=, which I noticed in [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/efaq/New-in-Emacs-24.html][What's new in emacs24]] using
   *emacs25*. also [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/el-get][el-get]] existed, and now =package.el= was official
   too. I can't seem to [[https://github.com/dimitri/el-get/issues/1468][choose]] one, and great can use both.

   Yet, I could barely remember *Why I removed that package, what
   happen?*, *git-whatchanged* would have told me more if it was a
   *code*. To =org= organize was most sane thing till now
   [[https://github.com/rhoit/dot-emacs/blob/master/init.el][~/emacs.d/init.el]] was orgified (org-babel-tangle).

   In summary its,

   - highly opinionated configuration tracked in git
   - does'nt provide the any layer of abstraction
   - more of notes and rants and reason to do so

   Since, version [[https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/whats-new-in-emacs-27-1#startup-changes-in-emacs-27.1][27.1]] *emacs* supported [[https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html][XDG]] convention every thing
   can be in =~/.config/emacs=

** getting-it

   🧨 *DISCLAIMER:* 🐒 MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE BACKUP ⚠️ AUTHOR will
   _not_ be _responsible_ for the 🔥 _harm_ 🔥 cause by using this
   configuration.

   Oh! you wanna use my config! its super duper +easy+ ! may be in
   future I'm still +trying+ avoiding make the installer (literally
   don't know how) and just trying to get by my work.

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     $ git clone https://github.com/rhoit/dot-emacs /path/to/dot-emacs
   #+END_EXAMPLE

** why-this-config?

   There is absolutely no reason for you to use this config, it would
   be like first time 🏊 swimmer, who mostly likely drown with
   unnecessary amount of effort. Although I'm great at underwater so
   to say some what athletic *underachievers*.

   Time 🕥 and time 🕝 again I learned *elisp* just to forget with
   endless pondering and compromises, without ✍️ jotting things down,
   it would have been impossible to configure. May be this started for
   maintenance, now its more of rants taking over the configuration! 😎

   If you ask, would I have started with other's config? I would
   definitely say *YES*. But you should *understand* all-in-one
   package 📦 or distribution is like bringing gun 🔫 to the fist 👊
   fight. You might end up using less than 5 % of the *bloat*. And if
   you want to change or fix something it big 😫 pain to pealing
   layers after layers to find the actual root cause. Yet you might
   want to try these first

** troubleshooting

   While troubleshooting I go though these procedure (may not be in
   same ordering)

   - hate myself when it happens
   - *REMOVE* the damn plugin and *GET BACK TO WORK*
   - *throw* ERROR MSG at google and try *catching* relevant pages
   - may be waste few hrs with random *trials*
   - set debug variable

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
       (setq debug-on-error 1)
       (setq debug-on-quit t)  ;; C-g
     #+END_SRC

* CORE
** load-time

   Show emacs-init-time at startup

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook (lambda ()
         (message (concat "conf-init-time: " (emacs-init-time) (format " gc: %d" gcs-done)))))
   #+END_SRC

   for comprehensive bench-marking install =benchmark-init=

   =M-x benchmark-init/show-durations-tree=

** server

   Stop ⛔ opening *emacs* for each file. Set default open application
   to *emacsclient*, or set it manually:

   =emacsclient --no-wait--alternate-editor=emacs [FILE]=

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (require 'server)
     (unless (server-running-p)
       (server-start))
   #+END_SRC

** encoding

   Set language to *English* all encoding in Unicode.

   #+HEADER: :results silent
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (setq set-default-coding-system 'utf-8)
     (setq locale-coding-system 'utf-8)

     (set-buffer-file-coding-system 'utf-8)
     (set-language-environment "English")  ;; Set up multilingual environment
   #+END_SRC

** backup

   I don't like mess every where, there is better things for that
   called git!

   #+HEADER: :results silent
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (setq backup-directory-alist (quote ((".*" . "~/.cache/emacs_backup/"))))
     (setq make-backup-files nil)
     (setq auto-save-default nil)
     (setq create-lockfiles nil)
   #+END_SRC

** big files

   Warn when opening files bigger than 1 MiB. yup *emacs* kitchen sink
   can open 🌇 image, PDF but seriously 😵 ?

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (setq large-file-warning-threshold (* 1 1024 1024))
   #+END_SRC

   You might wonder why that random number!

   | kilobyte (kB)  | 1000 bytes     |
   | [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibibyte][kibibyte]] (KiB) | 1024 bytes, kB |

   Since digital systems worked in binary, yet *defacto* is in base of
   2, Still interface don't show *kibi*, *mebi*, *gibi*. I don't think
   I'm only one who feel 😠 cheated getting HDD of *1 TB* and you
   getting *0.931* TB.

** pacman

   There are many 📦 package managers for *emacs*, ranging from simple
   scripts to download files from [[https://www.emacswiki.org][EmacsWiki]] to full-featured package
   management solutions like [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight.el]], these are few I have used

   Its *2020*, it has been harder to maintain packages with two
   managers. Finally decided to drop *el-get* in favor of build in
   [[package.el]].

*** package.el

    Add package other sources

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (require 'package) ;; after 24 its pre-loaded
      (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.config/emacs/elpa/")
      (add-to-list 'package-archives '("marmalade" . "http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/") t)
      (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") t)
      (add-to-list 'package-archives '("org" . "https://orgmode.org/elpa/") t)
      (package-initialize)
    #+END_SRC

    Use =M-x package-refresh-contents= to reload the list of packages
    after adding these for the first time.

    #+BEGIN_HTML
      # <p>Updating all packages is kinda strange chore type
      <kbd>M</kbd>-<kbd>x</kbd> <code>package-list-packages</code>
      which will take you to the <b>Packages</b> buffer, and then type
      <kbd>U</kbd> <kbd>x</kbd>.</p>
    #+END_HTML

    - <2020-02-02 Sun>

      having troubles with org-version babel [[https://github.com/io12/org-fragtog/issues/1][support]]. using org
      package-archives for latest stuff.

*** why-no-use-package

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      The use-package macro allows you to isolate package configuration
      both performance-oriented and, well, tidy.
    #+END_EXAMPLE

    But My packages are already organized using *org-mode* and the
    current init time is below /0.5 s/ given by =emacs-init-time=
    within /2.0 s/ in total or Just I don't use tons of package.

    Or change my [[https://github.com/rhoit/dot-emacs/issues/new][mind]]!

*** el-get
    :PROPERTIES:
    :header-args: :tangle no
    :END:

    [[https://github.com/dimitri/el-get][el-get]] is the package manager, which is similar to *apt-get*. Not
    using since starting of *2020*.

    #+BEGIN_HTML
      <details><summary>More</summary>
    #+END_HTML

    Its bit tricky to make both *ELPA* and *el-get* work together, but
    after years of procrastination, some how this works, you should
    load *el-get* first, but *emacs24+* loads =package.el= by default,
    thats why put this magic line before loading *el-get* =(setq
    package-enable-at-startup nil)=

    #+HEADER: :results silent
    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/el-get")
      (require 'el-get)
      (setq el-get-git-shallow-clone 't)
      (el-get 'sync)
    #+END_SRC

    To replicate a package set for another emacs installation is
    explain in el-get [[https://github.com/dimitri/el-get#replicating-a-package-set-on-another-emacs-installation][README]].

* UI

  As of today, most people who use *vi* or *emacs* are [[https://github.com/fuqcool/atom-emacs-mode#deprecated][incapable]] of
  using the other editor without using curse words 😡. Not
  surprisingly normal people without prior knowledge any text editor
  are pretty comfortable even 🪟 *notepad* make much more sense than
  *emacs* or *vi*. Yes you can pretty much do any *text foo* with
  these editor, even without touching 🐁 pointing device, but really
  does it really need to be like this.

** early-init

   Version [[https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/whats-new-in-emacs-27-1#startup-changes-in-emacs-27.1][27.1]] introduces [[https://github.com/rhoit/dot-emacs/blob/master/early-init.el][~/emacs.d/early-init.el]], which is run
   before [[https://github.com/rhoit/dot-emacs/blob/master/init.el][~/emacs.d/init.el]], before package and UI initialization
   happens. Themes and UI components can be setup here, which finally
   solves flickering UI.

** theme

*** theme-switch

    Worst part of switching theme by loading is active theme is one
    disabled before loading the new one! this 🪄 trick was stolen from
    [[https://github.com/thapakazi][@thapakazi]].

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (defun theme-switch (theme)
        "Disables any currently active themes and loads THEME."
        ;; This interactive call is taken from `load-theme'
        (interactive
         (list (intern (completing-read "Load custom theme: "
                                        (mapc 'symbol-name
                                              (custom-available-themes))))))
        (let ((enabled-themes custom-enabled-themes))
          (mapc #'disable-theme custom-enabled-themes)
          (load-theme theme t)))
    #+END_SRC

** scroll

   Unfortunately *emacs* 💈 [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SmoothScrolling][scrolling]] 💈 is not smooth, and riddled
   with bugs, although =pixel-scroll-mode=, available since *v26*, there
   are numerous scrolling options but it doesn't feel natural.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
     (require 'smooth-scroll)
     (smooth-scroll-mode t)

     ;; (setq scroll-conservatively 100000)
     (setq scroll-conservatively 0) ;; cursor on the middle of the screen
     ;; (setq scroll-preserve-screen-position 1)

     (setq scroll-margin 0)
     (setq scroll-up-aggressively 0.01)
     (setq scroll-down-aggressively 0.01)
     (setq auto-window-vscroll nil)

     (setq mouse-wheel-progressive-speed 10)
     (setq mouse-wheel-follow-mouse 't)
   #+END_SRC

*** scroll-horizontal

    Similar to *nano* single line horizontal scroll in *v26.1*
    introduced new feature, which only current line with cursor to be
    horizontally scrolled left or right window margin.

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
      (setq auto-hscroll-mode 'current-line)
    #+END_SRC

** line-number

   As in this [[http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_line_number_mode.html][article]] of *ergoemacs*, 2 line numbers mode is been
   📦 packaged with *emacs*.

   | year | emacs | package                          |
   |------+-------+----------------------------------|
   | 2009 |    23 | linum-mode                       |
   | 2018 |    26 | global-display-line-numbers-mode |

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     ;; (global-display-line-numbers-mode)
   #+END_SRC

   I used multiple [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/LineNumbers][line number]] plugins over years now, [[https://github.com/thefrontside/frontmacs/blob/master/frontmacs-windowing.el][frontmacs]]
   config stood out for me the, but *linum* give lots of flicker, now
   using with *nlinum* which is quite good.

   #+HEADER: :results silent
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (require 'nlinum)

     (setq nlinum-delay t)
     (setq nlinum-highlight-current-line t)
     (setq nlinum-format " %4d ")

     (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'nlinum-mode)
     (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'nlinum-mode)
   #+END_SRC

** initial-screen

   #+HEADER: :results silent
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (setq inhibit-startup-message t)
     (setq inhibit-splash-screen t)
   #+END_SRC

** mode line

   The mode line contains textual summary about the buffer, such as
   its name, associated file, depth of recursive editing, and major
   and minor modes.

*** [[https://github.com/emacsmirror/diminish][diminish]]

    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      When we diminish a mode, we are saying we want it to continue
      doing its work for us, but we no longer want to be reminded of
      it. It becomes a night worker, like a janitor; it becomes an
      invisible man; it remains a component, perhaps an important one,
      sometimes an indispensable one, of the mechanism that maintains
      the day-people's world, but its place in their thoughts is
      diminished, usually to nothing. As we grow old we diminish more
      and more such thoughts, such people, usually to nothing.

      -- Will Mengarini
    #+END_QUOTE

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (require 'diminish)
    #+END_SRC

*** mode icons

    Its normal to use 5-10 modes on a buffer, which make the mode line
    full of clutter why not use icons!

    #+ATTR_HTML: title="modline-screenshot"

    #+END_SRC

** tabbar

   [[https://github.com/rhoit/dot-emacs/blob/master/config/tabbar.cfg.el][tabbar]] is something familiar to modern 🍭 GUI system, there is
   still the gap, like key-bindings, close buttons and icons which is
   which [[https://github.com/mattfidler/tabbar-ruler.el][tabbar-ruler]] tries to address.

   #+ATTR_HTML: title="tabbar-screenshot"

* UX

  Fundamentally *emacs* is more over a scratchpad for *elisp*, which
  has been mistaken for the *editor*. Just 30+ years focused on
  features accumulation with barely any attention to GUI, I'm baffled
  when people come up with ⌨️ keybinding for each mode and mode to
  manage them again with keybindings. I'm one of those who can't
  remember all those fancy keyboard *kungfu*. And why do they
  generalize everyone uses same key layout and so call most efficient
  *vi* binding, just 🔒 locks me inside without the exit🚪!

** oem

   I don't understand why laptops 💻 OEM constantly change the key
   layouts. But why perfectly good layout are replace by terrible
   designs, Not to mention combining @@html:<kbd>@@ delete
   @@html:</kbd>@@ and @@html:<kbd>@@ backspace @@html:</kbd>@@.

   Some time you need to [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/DEL-Does-Not-Delete.html][explicitly]] say what to do.

   *vi* users can't seems to escape from it ever, (Esc is [[https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-50408649][back]]), and
   copy 🐈 OEM does not know where to [[https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/by5fy4/backspace_and_delete_keys_next_to_power_button_on/][place]] *power* ⚡ button.

    Hotkey for *font dialog* is kinda absurd, that to for changing
    font-face, although for resize has *Ctrl* *mouse-scroll* might be
    sensible option.

    In the effort of not being weird *Shift* *mouse-primary-click* is
    used in region/text selection =mouse-save-then-kill=.

    *so called wow moments*

    as you think selecting selection, emacs binds the selection
    keyboard free, when followed by *mouse-secondary-click* if its not
    in conflict.

*** highlight-indent-guides

    After years using [[https://github.com/antonj/Highlight-Indentation-for-Emacs][highlight indentation]] with performance issues
    and shifting through multiple 🍴 fork and patches, I have moved to
    [[https://github.com/DarthFennec/highlight-indent-guides][highlight-indent-guides]] has much better compatibility. Although I
    hate default fill method.

*** projectile

    If your source consist of hundreds of line then don't be like me
    use [[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile][projectile]] mode like [[https://github.com/krazedkrish][@krazedkrish]].

    #+BEGIN_HTML
      <p>ya <kbd>C</kbd>-<kbd>S</kbd>-<kbd>p</kbd> for select line
      previous, just get along with it, have you tried it in

      the <code>helm-projectile</code>.</p>
    #+END_HTML

** white-spaces

   If you have working with non-emacs people sooner or later you might
   face this problem, those pesky trailing spaces/tabs.

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     Phenomenal Cosmic Powers! Itty Bitty trailing spaces!
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   Although end result might be same but it all shows in diff, ideally
   there should be no empty lines at the beginning of a file, no empty
   lines at the end of a file, no trailing whitespace, no mixture of
   tabs and spaces, etc.

   older =delete-trailing-whitespace= command, that simply deletes
   trailing white-space.

   =whitespace-cleanup= aware of the whitespace-style variable, used
   by whitespace-mode.

   different types of hooks

   - write-file-hooks
   - before-save-hooks

   #+HEADER: :results silent
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (defun nuke-trailing ()
       (add-hook 'write-file-hooks 'delete-trailing-whitespace)
       (add-hook 'before-save-hooks 'whitespace-cleanup))

     (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'nuke-trailing)
   #+END_SRC

   [[https://github.com/nflath/hungry-delete][hungry-delete]] mode is interesting but still its quirky, mapping it
   to default *delete/backspace* will result typing your needed
   white-spaces back again! So as the mode its *NO*, *NO*. Manually
   toggling the mode just to delete few continous white spaces. Naah!

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (require 'hungry-delete)
     (global-set-key (kbd "S-<backspace>") 'hungry-delete-backward)
   #+END_SRC

   There is the interesting outlook of [[https://github.com/hrehfeld/emacs-smart-hungry-delete/issues][smart-hungry-delete]].

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (require 'smart-hungry-delete)

     ;; (global-set-key (kbd "<delete>") '(lambda ()
     ;;  (if use-region-p '(smart-hungry-delete-forward-char) '(delete-char))))
   #+END_SRC

   Of course emacs can add newline at *End Of File* just to make sure
   *git* doesn't go crazy! for unchanged files. But don't enable it
   let fancy IDE people wonder how to remove newline at EOF.

   *CAUTION! BUT MOST OF WILL JUST MAKE MESS*

** LSP

   [[https://langserver.org/][Language Server Protocol]] is a JSON-RPC protocol to delegate
   language aware features to a common server process using generic
   LSP client. The current lsp [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-current/][specifications]] was proposed by
   Microsoft as a way for different editors and development
   environments to share language analysis back-ends. If you’d like to
   read more about the inner workings, consider this [[ https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/overviews/lsp/overview/][post]].

* PYTHON

  Welcome to flying circus 🎪.

  My *python* familiarity predates *emacs*, It definitely should have
  its own section by now (<2021-05-27 Thu>) but I strangely even after
  dabbling through [[https://gitlab.com/rhoit/py-exec][py-exec]], python configuration has been simplest for
  decades.

  Recently I have been testing [[language server protocol][lsp]] for development it has never been
  better, countless hours wasted configuring code jumps using [[ggtags]]
  gives be nightmare which never worked out in practical sense .

** jedi

   Since *python3.3* virtual environment can be created using =python
   -m venv env= without *python-virtualenv*.

** venv

   Yes! we work on *virtual environment (venv)*, and we do love to
   *source* them, who can't seems to get things strait especially in
   *unix* systems.

   In reality venv just switches executable, seriously loading *venv*
   might be sane for *terminal* operation or running errands with
   *pip*. but for running just execute directly form
   =./venv/bin/python your.py=.

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     Damn don't try to solve artificial problems! so goes for idiotic
     venv modes trying to find *venv* folder.

   Yet for emacs environment using lsp and console this might only
   option! yeah I'm eating on my own words bite me! but seriously all
   env packages gives me creeps.

** scons

   If any one had created the Makefile in this day an age, it would
   definitely should be considered as 😖 crime. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)][Make]] came out in 1976
   and did more that what it promised to do now it has started showing
   the age. Many of complex projects are still handled by the Make
   which is shows the robustness of the system but its excruciatingly
   difficult to wrap you head around it. Now days Makefile is mostly
   the vomit 🤮 of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automake][automake]] which I find absolutely ridiculous.

   After years of ignorance and pain staking writing Makefile I have
   to hang the 🏳️ white flag. Its worst than *elisp* which has at least
   documentation you don't wander around searching how to do the
   simplest task . At times it made me think why not replace it with
   bash script! but make was built to replace bash script, do you
   sense the conundrum.

   The SCons Github [[https://github.com/SCons/scons/wiki/FromMakeToScons][wiki]] has an in-depth explanation about why Make
   comes up short. But if some one told me it was written in 🐍 python
   I would have been sold in first palace, Let see where it leads to.

** [[http://emacsredux.com/blog/2013/05/22/smarter-navigation-to-the-beginning-of-a-line/][smarter move to beginning of line]]

   Normally *C-a* will move your cursor to 0th column of the line,
   this snippet takes consideration of the indentation, and for
   default behavior "repeat the action" which will toggle between the
   first non-whitespace character and the =bol=.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

** [[http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/modernization_upcase-word.html][toggle lettercase]]

   By default, you can use M-c to change the case of a character at
   the cursor's position. This also jumps you to the end of the
   word. However it is far more useful to define a new function by
   adding the following code to your emacs config file. Once you have
   done this, M-c will cycle through "all lower case", "Initial
   Capitals", and "ALL CAPS" for the word at the cursor position, or
   the selected text if a region is highlighted.
