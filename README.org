#+DESCRIPTION: my emacs config!
#+AUTHOR: rho
#+OPTIONS: num:t
#+STARTUP: overview

*DISCLAIMER:* :warning: AUTHOR will _not_ be _responsible_ for
the :fire: _harm_ :fire: cause by using this config :bangbang:

Its unlikely to harm,

but :dizzy_face: *MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE BACKUP* :monkey:

*NOTE*: Some section are in testing need manually intervention,
it doesn't work out of the box.

* INTRO

  I've been using /emacs/ since *2012*, It has been the love and hate
  story since day one, In summary *emacs rocks but rocks are not so
  pretty*, and here you are looking at not so *pretty* side.


  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    FYI "emacs vanilla is a lie"
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  It began with *single-file* =~/.emacs= with some random snippets
  from web. It soon grew into huge of /tweaks/ and /hacks/, with some
  /scripts/ of my own. The frequency of changes and roll-backs were so
  high it was'nt long *emacs* couldn't fit beside my other [[https://github.com/rhoit/my-config][config]].
  And *emacs* got its own *.git* repository, soon bulky *single-file*
  ran config was broken down into separate modules with long list of
  *cherry-picked* plugin with their own repository and version
  controls. There was even the time I used *system package manager* to
  manage them but it was too much work.

  Its difficult to maintain config, I have added and removed the
  packages over and over again and I still do. There have been times,
  when I just froze the update until its not supported by system. The
  major problem was the unmaintainability of these plugin versions
  each time I updated something. I didn't knew about =package.el=
  existance until it was listed in [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/efaq/New-in-Emacs-24.html][What's new in emacs24]].

  Thankfully the =el-get= was there with the familiarity =apt-get=,
  which could not only make the life easier but also discover new
  packages. This config is mostly based on =el-get= and with few
  =ELPA= and =MELPA=. After few outlandish rodeos, this has been the
  most sane approach I found, to convert [[https://github.com/rhoit/dot-emacs/blob/master/init.el][~/emacs.d/init.el]] =org= file,
  which made verbose easy to handle.

** getting it

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     $ git clone https://github.com/rhoit/dot-emacs /path/to/dot-emacs
   #+END_EXAMPLE

** how to build

   =configure= :construction_worker: , pulls down the [[https://github.com/dimitri/el-get][el-get]], and
   stuffs.

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     $ ./configure
     $ make
     $ make install
   #+END_SRC

** structure

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     dot-emacs
     ├── el-get                 # pacman
     ├── config                 # config subsection

   #+END_EXAMPLE

* CORE
** benchmarking

   install benchmark-init from el-get and put below code top of your
   config.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     ;;(let ((benchmark-init.el "~/.emacs.d/el-get/benchmark-init/benchmark-init.el"))
     ;; (when (file-exists-p benchmark-init.el)
     ;;    (load benchmark-init.el)))
   #+END_SRC

   then once your emacs started, run:

   =M-x benchmark-init/show-durations-tree=

   To check your package load time do

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     M-x emacs-init-time
   #+END_EXAMPLE

** emacs garbage collector

   based on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/3kqt6e/2_easy_little_known_steps_to_speed_up_emacs_start/][reddit]] post.

   I hoped this works but, haven't seen much difference, but if chrome
   just eats entire 4 GB of RAM :rage1: for no reason why not emacs,
   FYI your java based IDE will just eat up more than *200 Mb* to
   start.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (setq gc-cons-threshold 209715200)
   #+END_SRC

** emacs server

   Stop :no_entry_sign: opening *emacs* for each file. Set default open
   application using =emacsclient -n -a=emacs [FILE]=.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (require 'server)
     (unless (server-running-p)
       (server-start))
   #+END_SRC

** encoding

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (setq locale-coding-system 'utf-8)
     (set-language-environment 'utf-8)
     (set-terminal-coding-system 'utf-8)
     (set-keyboard-coding-system 'utf-8)
     (set-selection-coding-system 'utf-8)
     (prefer-coding-system 'utf-8)
   #+END_SRC

** backup

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (setq backup-directory-alist (quote ((".*" . "~/.cache/emacs_backup/"))))
     (setq make-backup-files nil)
   #+END_SRC

** update buffer

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (global-auto-revert-mode)
     ;;(setq auto-revert-verbose nil)
   #+END_SRC

** alias yes-or-no

   avoid typing complete 'yes' and 'no'

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (fset 'yes-or-no-p 'y-or-n-p)
   #+END_SRC

** recent files

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     ;; (recentf-mode nil)
   #+END_SRC

* PACMAN
** package.el

   Add package other sources

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") t)
   #+END_SRC

   Use =M-x package-refresh-contents= to reload the list of packages
   after adding these for the first time.

** el-get

   [[https://github.com/dimitri/el-get][el-get]] is the package manager, which is similar to *apt-get*. It
   has been while (after =emacs 24=) emacs got its own package
   manager, thinking of switching.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/el-get")
     (require 'el-get)
     (setq el-get-git-shallow-clone 't)
     (el-get 'sync)
   #+END_SRC

** my packages

   To replicate a package set for another emacs installation is
   explain in el-get [[https://github.com/dimitri/el-get#replicating-a-package-set-on-another-emacs-installation][README]].

   you can list current installed package using.

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     `(setq my-packages
         ',(mapcar #'el-get-as-symbol
               (el-get-list-package-names-with-status "installed")))
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   Might be wondering why there isn't any package *listed* here, coz I
   have broken down list into parts where its needed, you will see
   =(el-get 'sync '<package-name>)= if its requried before its
   configuration.

* [[https://github.com/rhoit/dot-emacs/blob/master/config/ui.cfg.el][UI/UX]]

  Basic configuration, like window size keybindings

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (load "~/.emacs.d/config/ui.cfg.el")
  #+END_SRC

  these are kind of strange bindings for beginner and for me too, so
  lets remove it

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (global-unset-key [(control prior)])
    (global-unset-key [(control next)])
  #+END_SRC

  I find these binding quite handful.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (require 'fill-column-indicator)
    (global-set-key [M-f4] 'save-buffers-kill-terminal)
    (global-set-key [(control f5)] '(lambda() (interactive)
                                    (load-file "~/.emacs.d/init.el")))
    (global-set-key [f6] '(lambda() (interactive)
                          (toggle-truncate-lines)
                          (fci-mode)))
  #+END_SRC

** shift-mouse selection

   We don't need *font dialog* options which is binded by default.
   Since, font resize has been binded to =C mouse scroll= does it.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (global-unset-key [(shift down-mouse-1)])
     (global-set-key [(shift down-mouse-1)] 'mouse-save-then-kill)
   #+end_src

** undo keybinds

   let keep things *simple* :see_no_evil: :hear_no_evil: :speak_no_evil:

   addition to the emacs bindings these few thing must have thing.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (when window-system
       (require 'undo-tree)
       (global-undo-tree-mode 1)
       (setq undo-tree-visualizer-timestamps t)
       (global-unset-key (kbd "C-/"))
       (defalias 'redo 'undo-tree-redo)
       (global-unset-key (kbd "C-z"))

   Unfortunately emacs :barber: scrolling :barber: is not smooth, its
   *2016* already.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

   if [[https://www.sublimetext.com/][sublime]] can have multiple selections, *emacs* can too..

   Here is [[https://youtu.be/jNa3axo40qM][video]] from [[http://emacsrocks.com/][Emacs Rocks!]] about it in [[http://emacsrocks.com/e13.html][ep13]].

** goto-last-change

   This is the gem feature, this might be true answer to the /sublime
   mini-map/ which is over rated, this is what you need.

   If you aren't using el-get here is the [[https://raw.github.com/emacsmirror/emacswiki.org/master/goto-last-change.el][source]], guessing it its
   avaliable in all major repository by now.

** [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/LineNumbers][line number]]

   Using ELPA here, this is was hard to get working properly with
   ELPA, load sequence, still don't know how its working now.

   seem =nlinum= has also change a lot, but didn't have time to
   explore.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (require 'nlinum)

** highlight current line

   Uses =shade-color= defined in [[https://github.com/rhoit/dot-emacs/blob/master/config/ui.cfg.el][config/ui.cfg.el]] to compute new
   intensity of given color and alpha value.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

** ansi-color

   Need to fix 265-color support, has been such for a long
   time, since we very few work on teminal colors it might
   not be fixed anytime sooner.

   This is what I meant [[https://camo.githubusercontent.com/67e508f03a93d4e9935e38ea201dff7cc32c0afd/68747470733a2f2f7261772e6769746875622e636f6d2f72686f69742f72686f69742e6769746875622e636f6d2f6d61737465722f73637265656e73686f74732f656d6163732d323536636f6c6f722e706e67][screenshot]] was produced using [[https://github.com/bekar/vt100_colors][code]].

* ORG-MODE

  This might be one of the most important modes of emacs which make
  the emacs distinct from every other editor. You should definately
  checkout org-mode. Like the emacs config it has become humongous.

** keyboard

   covered :sob:.
