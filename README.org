#+DESCRIPTION: my emacs config diaries!
#+AUTHOR: rho
#+OPTIONS: num:t
#+STARTUP: overview

*DISCLAIMER:* :warning: AUTHOR will _not_ be _responsible_ for
the :fire: _harm_ :fire: cause by using this config :bangbang:

*MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE BACKUP* :monkey:

*BEWARE:* AUTHOR does'nt know much *elisp*, so it doesn't work out of
the box, some section need manually interventions.

* INTRO

  I've been using /emacs/ since *2012*, It has been the love and hate
  story since day one, In summary *emacs rocks but rocks are not so
  pretty*, and here you are looking at not so *pretty* side.

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    FYI "emacs vanilla is a lie"
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  It began with *single-file* =~/.emacs= with some random snippets.
  Didn't took long to become monster, CHAOTIC MONSTER. It loved to
  *cherry-picked* plugin from different gardens (/not only git/) you
  guessed it, why don't you *apt-get* so I thought.

  Manually maintaining of was hard job, had too freeze them just
  because it newer one didn't work. And came =package.el=, which I
  noticed in [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/efaq/New-in-Emacs-24.html][What's new in emacs24]] using *emacs25*. [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/el-get][el-get]] was there,
  an now =package.el= was official too. I can't seem to [[https://github.com/dimitri/el-get/issues/1468][choose]] one,
  and great can use both.

  Yet, I could barely remember *Why I removed that package, what
  happen?*, *git-whatchanged* would have told me more if it was a
  *code*. To =org= organize was most sane thing till now
  [[https://github.com/rhoit/dot-emacs/blob/master/init.el][~/emacs.d/init.el]] was orgified.

** getting it

   oh! you wanna get my config! its super duper +easy+!

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     $ git clone https://github.com/rhoit/dot-emacs /path/to/dot-emacs
   #+END_EXAMPLE

** how to build

   =configure= :construction_worker: , pulls down the [[https://github.com/dimitri/el-get][el-get]], and
   magical stuffs.

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     $ ./configure
     $ make
     $ make install
   #+END_SRC

** structure

   This is the way do keep my things!

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     dot-emacs
     ├── el-get                 # pacman
     ├── config                 # config subsection
     │   ├── compile.cfg.el
     :   :
     │   └── tabbar.cfg.el
     ├── ...
     :
     ├── 00testing              # testing stuffs
     └── snippets               # yasnippet stuffs
         ├── fundamental-mode
         :
         └── python-mode
   #+END_EXAMPLE

* CORE
** benchmarking

   install benchmark-init from el-get and put below code top of your
   config.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     ;;(let ((benchmark-init.el "~/.emacs.d/el-get/benchmark-init/benchmark-init.el"))
     ;; (when (file-exists-p benchmark-init.el)
     ;;    (load benchmark-init.el)))
   #+END_SRC

   then once your emacs started, run:

   =M-x benchmark-init/show-durations-tree=

   To check your package load time do

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     M-x emacs-init-time
   #+END_EXAMPLE

** emacs garbage collector

   based on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/3kqt6e/2_easy_little_known_steps_to_speed_up_emacs_start/][reddit]] post.

   I hoped this works but, haven't seen much difference, but if chrome
   just eats entire 4 GB of RAM :rage1: for no reason why not emacs,
   FYI your java based IDE will just eat up more than *200 Mb* to
   start.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (setq gc-cons-threshold (* 100 1024 1024))
   #+END_SRC

** emacs server

   Stop :no_entry_sign: opening *emacs* for each file. Set default open
   application using =emacsclient -n -a=emacs [FILE]=.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (require 'server)
     (unless (server-running-p)
       (server-start))
   #+END_SRC

** encoding

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (setq locale-coding-system 'utf-8)
     (set-language-environment 'utf-8)
     (set-terminal-coding-system 'utf-8)
     (set-keyboard-coding-system 'utf-8)
     (set-selection-coding-system 'utf-8)
     (prefer-coding-system 'utf-8)
   #+END_SRC

** backup

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (setq backup-directory-alist (quote ((".*" . "~/.cache/emacs_backup/"))))
     (setq make-backup-files nil)
   #+END_SRC

** update buffer

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (global-auto-revert-mode)
     ;;(setq auto-revert-verbose nil)
   #+END_SRC

** alias yes-or-no

   avoid typing complete 'yes' and 'no'

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (fset 'yes-or-no-p 'y-or-n-p)
   #+END_SRC

** who writes ~10k lines in single file?

   Warn when opening files bigger than 1 MiB. yup emacs kitchen sink
   can open image, pdf but seriously? in emacs...

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (setq large-file-warning-threshold 1048576)
   #+END_SRC

   You might wonder why that random number!

   | kilobyte (kB)  | 1000 bytes     |
   | [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibibyte][kibibyte]] (KiB) | 1024 bytes, kB |

   Since digital systems worked in binary, shouldn't the defacto be
   base of 2, Still interface don't show *kibi*, *mebi*, *gibi*. I
   don't think I'm only one who feel cheated getting HDD of *1 TB* and
   you getting *0.931* TB.

** recent files

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     ;; (recentf-mode nil)
   #+END_SRC

* PACMAN
** package.el

   Add package other sources

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (require 'package) ;; after 24 its pre-loaded
     (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") t)
     (package-initialize)
   #+END_SRC

   Use =M-x package-refresh-contents= to reload the list of packages
   after adding these for the first time.

   *<2018-03-01>* finally got the setting right, had been refreshing
   it on every install.

* el-get

   [[https://github.com/dimitri/el-get][el-get]] is the package manager, which is similar to *apt-get*. It
   has been while (after =emacs 24=) emacs got its own package
   manager, thinking of switching.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/el-get")
     (require 'el-get)
     (setq el-get-git-shallow-clone 't)
     (el-get 'sync)
   #+END_SRC

** my packages

   To replicate a package set for another emacs installation is
   explain in el-get [[https://github.com/dimitri/el-get#replicating-a-package-set-on-another-emacs-installation][README]].

   you can list current installed package using.

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     `(setq my-packages
         ',(mapcar #'el-get-as-symbol
               (el-get-list-package-names-with-status "installed")))
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   Might be wondering why there isn't any package *listed* here, coz I
   have broken down list into parts where its needed, you will see
   =(el-get 'sync '<package-name>)= if its required before its
   configuration.

* [[https://github.com/rhoit/dot-emacs/blob/master/config/ui.cfg.el][UI/UX]]

  I'm baffled when people come up with config full keybinding, and for
  each mode they add another. And mode to manage those binding. I'm
  one of those who can't remember all those fancy keyboard *kungfu*.
  And why do they generalize everyone uses same key layout and so call
  most efficient *vi* binding, just locks me inside without the exit
  door!

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (load "~/.emacs.d/config/ui.cfg.el")
  #+END_SRC

** window

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     ;;; Window Size
     (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(height . 39))
     (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(width . 104))
   #+END_SRC

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (tool-bar-mode 0)
     (menu-bar-mode 0)
     (scroll-bar-mode 0)
     (defun toggle-bars-view()
       (interactive)
       (if tool-bar-mode (tool-bar-mode 0) (tool-bar-mode 1))
       (if menu-bar-mode (menu-bar-mode 0) (menu-bar-mode 1)))
     (global-set-key [f12] 'toggle-bars-view)
   #+END_SRC

** sane key bindings

   Although emacs key binding are logical and well thought, but some
   of them just too much out dated, but nothing weirdness new 2010 to
   present laptop *fn-Up/Down* for *PageUp/Down* and no *del* key! now
   no escape and function well done mac!

   Beginners find *Ctrl+v* jump outlandish and sometime also for me.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (global-set-key [(control v)] 'yank)

     ;;; since, C-x k <return> too much acrobat
     (global-set-key [(control d)] 'kill-buffer) ;; same as terminal

     (global-set-key [M-f4] 'save-buffers-kill-terminal)
   #+END_SRC

   these are kind of strange bindings for beginner and for me too, so
   lets remove it

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (global-unset-key [(control prior)])
     (global-unset-key [(control next)])
   #+END_SRC

   I find these binding quite handful.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (el-get 'sync 'fill-column-indicator)
     (require 'fill-column-indicator)

     (global-set-key (kbd "<f5>") 'redraw-display)
     (global-set-key [(control f5)] '(lambda() (interactive)
                                     (load-file "~/.emacs.d/init.el")))
     (global-set-key [f6] '(lambda() (interactive)
                           (toggle-truncate-lines)
                           (fci-mode)))
   #+END_SRC

** undotree

   *simplely* :see_no_evil: :hear_no_evil: :speak_no_evil:
   addition to the emacs bindings these few thing must have thing.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (el-get 'sync 'undo-tree)
     (when window-system
       (require 'undo-tree)
       (global-undo-tree-mode 1)
       (setq undo-tree-visualizer-timestamps t)
       (global-unset-key (kbd "C-/"))
       (defalias 'redo 'undo-tree-redo)
       (global-unset-key (kbd "C-z"))
       (global-set-key (kbd "C-z") 'undo-only)
       (global-set-key (kbd "C-S-z") 'redo))
   #+end_src

** text selection

   Some of the default behavious of emacs :shit: weird, text selection
   is on of them, some time its the *WOW* moment and other time its
   *WTF*.

*** replace selected text

    This is weird one when you expect selected text to be replaced,
    you end up in mess, thankfully there is the inbuild mode to fix
    this.

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (delete-selection-mode 1)
    #+END_SRC


*** changing font

    Hotkey for *font dialog* is kinda absurd, that to for changing
    font-face, although for resize has *Ctrl* *mouse-scroll* might be
    sensible option.

    In the effort of not being weird *Shift* *mouse-primary-click* is
    used in region/text selection =mouse-save-then-kill=.

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (global-unset-key [(shift down-mouse-1)])
      (global-set-key [(shift down-mouse-1)] 'mouse-save-then-kill)
    #+END_SRC

    *so called wow moments*

    as you think selecting selection, emacs binds the selection
    keyboard free, when followed by *mouse-secondary-click*.

*** [[https://github.com/magnars/expand-region.el][expand region]]

    Expand region increases the selected region by semantic
    units.

    Here is [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RvHz3vJ3kA][video]] from [[http://emacsrocks.com/][Emacs Rocks!]] about it in [[http://emacsrocks.com/e09.html][ep09]].

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (el-get 'sync 'expand-region)
      (require 'expand-region)
      (global-set-key (kbd "S-SPC") 'er/expand-region)
      (global-set-key (kbd "C-S-SPC") 'er/contract-region)
    #+END_SRC

** drag

   Its undeniable fact after using *org-mode* nothing is same, I have
   always wanted to move section up and down in my code too,
   *outline-mode* came close to parts, but setting comment header for
   each section is bit impractical just for dragging.

   After seeing [[https://github.com/prtx][@prtx]] using sublime, moving lines up and down, similar
   to word transpose *M-t* in emacs, I also want to same, made my mind
   to go though the hell once more to write the =elisp= again until i
   was saved by [[https://github.com/rejeep/drag-stuff.el][drag-stuff]].

   *<M-right/left>* bind seems redundant with *<C-right/left>* also it
   doesn't work in terminal, replacing it hopefull will not create any
   problem.

   *BEWARE*: it breaks the *org-mode* don't enable it in org!

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (el-get 'sync 'drag-stuff)
     (require 'drag-stuff)
     (drag-stuff-define-keys)
     (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'drag-stuff-mode)
   #+END_SRC

** smooth scroll

   Unfortunately emacs :barber: scrolling :barber: is not smooth.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (require 'smooth-scroll)
     (smooth-scroll-mode t)

     (setq scroll-conservatively 0) ;; cursor on the middle of the screen
     (setq scroll-up-aggressively 0.01)
     (setq scroll-down-aggressively 0.01)
     (setq auto-window-vscroll nil)

     (setq mouse-wheel-progressive-speed 10)
     (setq mouse-wheel-follow-mouse 't)
   #+END_SRC

** line-number

   Choosing differnt [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/LineNumbers][line number]] plugins over 5 years, [[https://github.com/thefrontside/frontmacs/blob/master/frontmacs-windowing.el][frontmacs]]
   config actually got it right on that looks great, but *linum* give
   lots of flicker, now experimenting with *nlinum*.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (require 'nlinum)

     (setq nlinum-delay t)

** mini-buffer

   Although [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][helm]] has coffer full with features, I havn't gone beyond
   the minibuffer. It took me while to get hang of helm, one of
   reasons might be constant flikering creation of helm temporary
   popup windows which I don't like.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

*** [[https://github.com/magnars/multiple-cursors.el][multiple cursor]]

    if [[https://www.sublimetext.com/][sublime]] can have multiple selections, *emacs* can too..

    Here is [[https://youtu.be/jNa3axo40qM][video]] from [[http://emacsrocks.com/][Emacs Rocks!]] about it in [[http://emacsrocks.com/e13.html][ep13]].

** goto-last-change

   This is the gem feature, this might be true answer to the /sublime
   mini-map/ which is over rated, this is what you need.

   If you aren't using el-get here is the [[https://raw.github.com/emacsmirror/emacswiki.org/master/goto-last-change.el][source]], guessing it its
   avaliable in all major repository by now.

   By default, you can use M-c to change the case of a character at

   word. However it is far more useful to define a new function by
   adding the following code to your emacs config file. Once you have
   done this, M-c will cycle through "all lower case", "Initial
   Capitals", and "ALL CAPS" for the word at the cursor position, or
   the selected text if a region is highlighted.
