#+DESCRIPTION: my emacs config diaries!
#+AUTHOR: rho
#+OPTIONS: num:t
#+STARTUP: overview

*BEWARE:* AUTHOR does'nt know much *elisp* and suffer from
*parenthesiophobia*, but couldn't stop tinker around.


* INTRO

  I've been using /emacs/ since *2012*, It has been the love and hate
  story since day one, In summary *emacs rocks but rocks are not so
  pretty*, and here you are looking at not so *pretty* side.

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    FYI "emacs vanilla is a lie"
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  It began with *single-file* =~/.emacs= with some random snippets.
  Didn't took long to become monster, CHAOTIC MONSTER. It loved to
  *cherry-picked* plugin from different gardens (/not only git/) you
  guessed it, why don't you *apt-get* so I thought.

  Manually maintaining of was hard job, had too freeze them just
  because it newer one didn't work. And came =package.el=, which I
  noticed in [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/efaq/New-in-Emacs-24.html][What's new in emacs24]] using *emacs25*. [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/el-get][el-get]] was there,
  an now =package.el= was official too. I can't seem to [[https://github.com/dimitri/el-get/issues/1468][choose]] one,
  and great can use both.

  Yet, I could barely remember *Why I removed that package, what
  happen?*, *git-whatchanged* would have told me more if it was a
  *code*. To =org= organize was most sane thing till now
  [[https://github.com/rhoit/dot-emacs/blob/master/init.el][~/emacs.d/init.el]] was orgified.

** getting it

   *DISCLAIMER:* :monkey: MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE BACKUP :warning:
   AUTHOR will _not_ be _responsible_ for the :fire: _harm_ :fire:
   cause by using this config :bangbang:

   oh! you wanna get my config! its super duper +easy+! may be in
   future I'm still +trying+ avoiding things just trying to get my
   work done, so may not work out of the box.

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     $ git clone https://github.com/rhoit/dot-emacs /path/to/dot-emacs
   #+END_EXAMPLE

** why this config?

   There is absolutely no reason for you to use this config, it would
   be like first time :swimmer: swimmer, who mostly likely drown with
   an unnecessary amount of effort. Although I'm great at underwater
   so to say some what athletic *underachievers*.

   Time and time again I learned *elisp* just to forget, endless
   pondering and compromises, without out jotting things down, it
   would be impossible to handle *emacs*. May be this started for
   maintenance, now its more of rants taking over the config! 😎

   If you ask, would I have started with other's config? I would
   definitely say *YES*. But you should *understand* all-in-one
   package emacs kit or distribution are like bringing 🔫 to the fist
   fight. You might just use less than 5% of the bloat if you want to
   change anything it pain of pealing though layers after layers to
   find the actual problem. Yet you might want to try these first

** how to build

   =configure= :construction_worker: , pulls down the [[https://github.com/dimitri/el-get][el-get]], and
   magical stuffs.

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     $ ./configure
     $ make
     $ make install
   #+END_SRC

   what about other system's, best of luck don't forget to ping me if
   you did it!

** structure

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     Entropy is important but not here
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   This is the way, I keep my things have been same for many year now!

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     dot-emacs
     ├── el-get                 # pacman
     ├── config                 # config subsection
     │   ├── compile.cfg.el
     :   :

         ├── fundamental-mode
         :
         └── python-mode
   #+END_EXAMPLE

** troubleshooting

   While troubleshooting I go though these procedure (may not be in
   same ordering)

   - hate myself when it happens
   - *REMOVE* the damn plugin and *GET BACK TO WORK*
   - *throw* ERROR MSG at google and try *catching* relevant pages
   - may be waste few hrs with random *trials*
   - set debug variable

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
       (setq debug-on-error 1)
       (setq debug-on-quit t)  ;; C-g
     #+END_SRC

* CORE
** garbage collector

   based on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/3kqt6e/2_easy_little_known_steps_to_speed_up_emacs_start/][reddit]] post.

   I hoped this works but, haven't seen much difference, but if chrome
   just eats entire 4 GB of RAM :rage1: for no reason why not emacs,
   FYI your java based IDE will just eat up more than *200 Mb* to
   start.

   https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/34342/is-there-any-downside-to-setting-gc-cons-threshold-very-high-and-collecting-ga

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (setq gc-cons-threshold (* 100 1024 1024))
   #+END_SRC

   <2018-03-26> finally understood why this wasn't working

** benchmarking

   install benchmark-init from el-get and put below code top of your
   config.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     ;;(let ((benchmark-init.el "~/.emacs.d/el-get/benchmark-init/benchmark-init.el"))
     ;; (when (file-exists-p benchmark-init.el)
     ;;    (load benchmark-init.el)))
   #+END_SRC

   then once your emacs started, run:

   =M-x benchmark-init/show-durations-tree=

   To check your package load time do

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     M-x emacs-init-time
   #+END_EXAMPLE

** emacs server

   Stop :no_entry_sign: opening *emacs* for each file. Set default open
   application using =emacsclient -n -a=emacs [FILE]=.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (require 'server)
     (unless (server-running-p)
       (server-start))
   #+END_SRC

** encoding

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (setq locale-coding-system 'utf-8)
     (set-language-environment 'utf-8)
     (set-terminal-coding-system 'utf-8)
     (set-keyboard-coding-system 'utf-8)
     (set-selection-coding-system 'utf-8)
     (prefer-coding-system 'utf-8)
   #+END_SRC

** backup

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (setq backup-directory-alist (quote ((".*" . "~/.cache/emacs_backup/"))))
     (setq make-backup-files nil)
   #+END_SRC

** update buffer

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (global-auto-revert-mode)
     ;;(setq auto-revert-verbose nil)
   #+END_SRC

** alias yes-or-no

   avoid typing complete 'yes' and 'no'

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (fset 'yes-or-no-p 'y-or-n-p)
   #+END_SRC

** who writes ~10k lines in single file?

   Warn when opening files bigger than 1 MiB. yup emacs kitchen sink
   can open image, PDF but seriously? in emacs...

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (setq large-file-warning-threshold 1048576)
   #+END_SRC

   You might wonder why that random number!

   | kilobyte (kB)  | 1000 bytes     |
   | [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibibyte][kibibyte]] (KiB) | 1024 bytes, kB |

   Since digital systems worked in binary, shouldn't the defacto be
   base of 2, Still interface don't show *kibi*, *mebi*, *gibi*. I
   don't think I'm only one who feel cheated getting HDD of *1 TB* and
   you getting *0.931* TB.

** recent files

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     ;; (recentf-mode nil)
   #+END_SRC

* PACMAN
** package.el

   Add package other sources

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (require 'package) ;; after 24 its pre-loaded
     (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") t)
     (package-initialize)
   #+END_SRC

   Use =M-x package-refresh-contents= to reload the list of packages
   after adding these for the first time.

   *<2018-03-01>* finally got the setting right, had been refreshing
   it on every install.

* el-get

   [[https://github.com/dimitri/el-get][el-get]] is the package manager, which is similar to *apt-get*. It
   has been while (after =emacs 24=) emacs got its own package
   manager, thinking of switching.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/el-get")
     (require 'el-get)
     (setq el-get-git-shallow-clone 't)
     (el-get 'sync)
   #+END_SRC

** my packages

   To replicate a package set for another emacs installation is
   explain in el-get [[https://github.com/dimitri/el-get#replicating-a-package-set-on-another-emacs-installation][README]].

   you can list current installed package using.

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     `(setq my-packages
         ',(mapcar #'el-get-as-symbol
               (el-get-list-package-names-with-status "installed")))
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   Might be wondering why there isn't any package *listed* here, coz I
   have broken down list into parts where its needed, you will see
   =(el-get 'sync '<package-name>)= if its required before its
   configuration.

* [[https://github.com/rhoit/dot-emacs/blob/master/config/ui.cfg.el][UI/UX]]

  As of today, most people who use *vi* or *emacs* are [[https://github.com/fuqcool/atom-emacs-mode#deprecated][incapable]] of
  using the other editor without using curse words :rage1:. Not
  suprizinly normal people without prior knowledge any text editor are
  pretty comfortable even *windows* notepad make much more sense than
  *emacs* or *vi*. Yes you can pretty much do any *text foo* with
  these editor, even without touching :mouse2: pointing device, but
  really does it really need to be like this.

  Fundamentally *emacs* is more over a scratchpad for *elisp*, which
  has been mistaken for the editor. Just 30+ years focused on editing
  features accumulation with barely any attention to GUI, I'm baffled
  when people come up with config full keybinding, and for each mode
  they add another. And mode to manage those binding. I'm one of those
  who can't remember all those fancy keyboard *kungfu*.  And why do
  they generalize everyone uses same key layout and so call most
  efficient *vi* binding, just locks me inside without the exit door!

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (load "~/.emacs.d/config/ui.cfg.el")
  #+END_SRC

** window

   #+BEGIN_HTML
     GNU Emacs has built-in support for full-screen since version
     24.4. New commands <code>toggle-frame-fullscreen</code> and
     <code>toggle-frame-maximized</code>, bound to <kbd>F11</kbd> and
     <kbd>M</kbd>-<kbd>f10</kbd>, respectively. But most window
     manager in <b>linux</b> toggle's windows full-screen with
     <kbd>M</kbd>-<kbd>f11</kbd>.
   #+END_HTML

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     ;; lets reserve it for something i.e realgud
     (global-unset-key [f11])

     ;;; Window Size
     ;;(add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(height . 39))
     ;;(add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(width . 104))
   #+END_SRC

   Its kinda distracting having toolbar, menu bar around, so lets hide
   it and also set some handy key to toggle it.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (tool-bar-mode 0)
     (menu-bar-mode 0)
     (scroll-bar-mode 0)

     (defun toggle-bars-view()
       (interactive)
       (if tool-bar-mode (tool-bar-mode 0) (tool-bar-mode 1))
       (if menu-bar-mode (menu-bar-mode 0) (menu-bar-mode 1)))
     (global-set-key [f12] 'toggle-bars-view)
   #+END_SRC

** sane key bindings

   Although most of the *emacs* key binding are sill relevant till
   this day. I can not stop to appreciation the *thought* and *design*
   went on building it. But recent times things have escalated quickly
   especially in laptop constantly changing the key layouts and All
   thanks to *fn* key now there is one more meta key to offset.

   It seem more of "think +different+ stupid" and other shouting
   *stupidity is cool!*. And even seasoned *vi* users can't seems to
   escape from it ever, well done mac!

   #+BEGIN_VERSE
     there is the *power* button near to backspace,
     forcing you to type correctly or *power off* the machine!
   #+END_VERSE

   Not to mention missing *del* key, but some of them have decided del
   should also do *backspace* although emacs its [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/DEL-Does-Not-Delete.html][confused]] and need our
   help!

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     ;;; you might not need this
     (normal-erase-is-backspace-mode 1)
   #+END_SRC

   Beginners find *Ctrl+v* jump outlandish and sometime also for me.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (global-set-key [(control v)] 'yank)

     ;;; since, C-x k <return> too much acrobat
     (global-set-key [(control d)] 'kill-buffer) ;; same as terminal

     (global-set-key [M-f4] 'save-buffers-kill-terminal)
   #+END_SRC

   I find these binding quite handful.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (el-get 'sync 'fill-column-indicator)
     (require 'fill-column-indicator)

     (global-set-key (kbd "<f5>") 'redraw-display)
     (global-set-key [(control f5)] '(lambda() (interactive)
                                     (load-file "~/.emacs.d/init.el")))
     (global-set-key [f6] '(lambda() (interactive)
                           (toggle-truncate-lines)
                           (fci-mode)))
   #+END_SRC



** undo

   =C-z= is synomous to undo not for emacs these, may be this is much
   needed thing!

   there is the great package =undo tree=, addition to being fancy it
   it not realiable and bring you in misery. :disappointed_relieved:

   *BEWARE*: It fancy but not reliable, decided not to use

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     ;; (el-get 'sync 'undo-tree)
     ;; (require 'undo-tree)
     ;; (global-undo-tree-mode 1)
     ;; (setq undo-tree-visualizer-timestamps t)
     (global-unset-key (kbd "C-/"))
     ;; (defalias 'redo 'undo-tree-redo)
     (global-unset-key (kbd "C-z"))
     (global-set-key (kbd "C-z") 'undo-only)
     (global-set-key (kbd "C-S-z") 'redo)
   #+END_SRC

** text selection

   Some of the default behaviors of emacs :shit: weird, text selection
   is on of them, some time its the *WOW* moment and other time its
   *WTF*.

*** replace selected text

    This is weird one when you expect selected text to be replaced,
    you end up in mess, thankfully there is the in-build mode to fix
    this.

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (delete-selection-mode 1)
    #+END_SRC

*** changing font

    Hotkey for *font dialog* is kinda absurd, that to for changing
    font-face, although for resize has :mouse2: *Ctrl* *mouse-scroll*
    might be sensible option.

    In the effort of not being weird *Shift* *mouse-primary-click* is
    used in region/text selection =mouse-save-then-kill=.

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (global-unset-key [(shift down-mouse-1)])
      (global-set-key [(shift down-mouse-1)] 'mouse-save-then-kill)
    #+END_SRC

    *so called wow moments*

    as you think selecting selection, emacs binds the selection
    keyboard free, when followed by *mouse-secondary-click*.

*** [[https://github.com/magnars/expand-region.el][expand region]]

    Expand region increases the selected region by semantic
    units.

    Here is [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RvHz3vJ3kA][video]] from [[http://emacsrocks.com/][Emacs Rocks!]] about it in [[http://emacsrocks.com/e09.html][ep09]].

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (el-get 'sync 'expand-region)
      (require 'expand-region)

      (global-set-key (kbd "C-S-SPC") 'er/expand-region)
      (global-set-key (kbd "C-SPC") '(lambda()
          "set-mark when nothing is selected"
          (interactive)
          (if (use-region-p)
              (er/contract-region 1)
              (call-interactively 'set-mark-command))))
    #+END_SRC

** drag

   Its undeniable fact after using *org-mode* nothing is same, I have
   always wanted to move section up and down in my code too,
   *outline-mode* came close to parts, but setting comment header for
   each section is bit impractical just for dragging.

   After seeing [[https://github.com/prtx][@prtx]] using sublime, moving lines up and down, similar
   to word transpose *M-t* in emacs, I also want to same, made my mind
   to go though the hell once more to write the =elisp= again until i
   was saved by [[https://github.com/rejeep/drag-stuff.el][drag-stuff]].

   *<M-right/left>* bind seems redundant with *<C-right/left>* also it
   doesn't work in terminal, replacing it hopefully will not create any
   problem.

   *BEWARE*: it breaks the *org-mode* don't enable it in org!

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (el-get 'sync 'drag-stuff)
     (require 'drag-stuff)
     (drag-stuff-define-keys)
     (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'drag-stuff-mode)
   #+END_SRC

** smooth scroll

   Unfortunately emacs :barber: scrolling :barber: is not smooth.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (require 'smooth-scroll)
     (smooth-scroll-mode t)

     (setq scroll-conservatively 0) ;; cursor on the middle of the screen
     (setq scroll-up-aggressively 0.01)

     (setq auto-window-vscroll nil)

     (setq mouse-wheel-progressive-speed 10)
     (setq mouse-wheel-follow-mouse 't)
   #+END_SRC

** line-number

   Choosing different [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/LineNumbers][line number]] plugins over 5 years, [[https://github.com/thefrontside/frontmacs/blob/master/frontmacs-windowing.el][frontmacs]]
   config actually got it right on that looks great, but *linum* give
   lots of flicker, now experimenting with *nlinum*.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

** debugger

   Although I barely use *debugger*, lets say I'm more of =print()=
   person, may be because I work much with =python= than
   =C=. Nevertheless, a good IDE should have debugger, but emacs is
   +TextEditor+ OS, and ships with *Grand Unified Debugger* (GUD), its
   fairly usable with terrible defaults and not to mention with more
   key bindings.

* ORG-MODE

  This might be one of the most important modes of emacs which make
  the emacs distinct from every other editor. You should definitely
  checkout *org-mode*. Like the emacs config it has out grown.

** keybindings

   org-mode introduces to the different word and

   all but one complain is its keybinding which throws the normal
   convention out of the box (just bugging emacs hasn't be great on
   defaults)

   removing pesky keybinds for consistency.
   here is the map what I/normal user expect and reality.

*** running at venv

    Yes! we work on *virtual environment (venv)*, and we do love to
    *source* them except some *anaconda* idiots, who can't seems to
    get things strait especially in *unix* systems.

    In reality venv just switches executable, seriously loading *venv*
    might be sane for *terminal* operation or running errands with
    *pip*. but for running just execute directly form
    =./venv/bin/python your.py=.

    Damn don't try to solve artificial problems! so goes for idiotic
    venv modes trying to find *venv* folder.

   Normally *C-a* will move your cursor to 0th column of the line,
   this snippet takes consideration of the indentation, and for
   default behavior "repeat the action" which will toggle between the
   first non-whitespace character and the =bol=.

** [[http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/modernization_upcase-word.html][toggle lettercase]]

   By default, you can use M-c to change the case of a character at
   the cursor's position. This also jumps you to the end of the
   word. However it is far more useful to define a new function by
   adding the following code to your emacs config file. Once you have
   done this, M-c will cycle through "all lower case", "Initial
   Capitals", and "ALL CAPS" for the word at the cursor position, or
   the selected text if a region is highlighted.
